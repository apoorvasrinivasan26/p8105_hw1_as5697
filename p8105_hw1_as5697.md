==========

**This problem focuses on variable types and coercion.**

Problem\_1.1
------------

*The code chunk below creates a data frame of a random sample of size 10, a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2, a character and a factor vector.*

``` r
problem1_df = tibble(
  rsamp = runif(10, 0, 5),
  vec_log = rsamp > 2,
  vec_char = c("I", "hope", "I", "did", "okay", "for", "my", "first", "P8105", "homework"),
  vec_fac = factor(c("heads", "tails", "heads", "heads", "tails", "heads", "tails", "tails", "heads", "tails"))
)
```
